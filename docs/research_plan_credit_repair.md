4. What are the most common and effective credit repair workflows that the software should support?
5. What are the technical requirements and APIs for integrating with the major credit bureaus?
6. What are the essential features from the perspective of a credit repair professional?
7. What are the key legal disclaimers and disclosures that must be presented to consumers?

## Resource Strategy
- Primary data sources: Official government websites (FTC, CFPB), legal information websites, and established financial industry publications.
- Search strategies:
  - "Fair Credit Reporting Act for credit repair organizations"
  - "Credit Repair Organizations Act compliance guide"
  - "credit repair software development best practices"
  - "credit repair data security standards"
  - "credit bureau integration API for credit repair"
  - "essential features of credit repair software"
  - "legal disclaimers for credit repair companies"

## Verification Plan
- Source requirements: Prioritize government (.gov) and academic (.edu) sources. Use at least 3-5 independent, credible sources for each key area of research.
- Cross-validation: Compare information from different sources to identify consistencies and discrepancies.

## Expected Deliverables
- A comprehensive research report in markdown format: `docs/credit_repair_industry_report.md`.
- A source tracking file: `docs/sources.md`.

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search
- Justification: The task requires gathering a broad range of information from various sources. A search-focused workflow is the most efficient way to collect the necessary data before synthesizing it into the final report.
