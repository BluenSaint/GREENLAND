{"extracted_information": "The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), enacted in 1970 (Public Law No. 91-508), is a federal law designed to promote accuracy, fairness, and the privacy of personal information collected by Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs). It establishes a framework of Fair Information Practices, including rights of data quality (access and correction), data security, use limitations, data destruction requirements, notice, user participation (consent), and accountability. The Act applies to consumers, furnishers (entities sending information to CRAs), and users (entities requesting reports).\n\n**Key Provisions and Definitions:**\n*   **Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs):** Entities that regularly assemble or evaluate consumer credit information for furnishing consumer reports to third parties. This includes the 'Big Three' (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion), regional CRAs, and even private investigators, detective agencies, collection agencies, and college placement offices. The CFPB has proposed expanding FCRA coverage to data brokers who share credit reporting information.\n*   **Consumer Credit Reports:** Contain financial information (credit card balances, mortgages), basic identifying info (name, address, SSN, marital status, employment), public records (arrests, bankruptcies, tax liens), tradelines, collection items, current employment history, and requests for the report. Certain information like 'transaction and experience' data is excluded, as is information on consumer income or assets.\n*   **Investigative Consumer Reports (ICRs):** Dossiers compiled from personal interviews, including sensitive information on character, reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living. They have heightened protections, requiring notice to the consumer within three days of request and allowing consumers to request explanations of the investigation's nature and scope.\n*   **Credit Score:** A 'grade' of creditworthiness, influencing access to credit and interest rates. Factors include amount owed, payment history, new credit inquiries, and types of credit. Companies do not disclose precise algorithms. FACTA (2003) and Dodd-Frank (2010) require disclosure of credit scores, especially in adverse action or risk-based pricing scenarios. Free credit scores can be obtained from credit card issuers, lenders, or non-profits.\n*   **Credit Header:** Identifying information from a credit report (name, mother's maiden name, DOB, sex, address, SSN). The FTC previously allowed CRAs to sell headers without FCRA protections, but EPIC advocates for its inclusion under FCRA due to privacy harms and inaccuracy issues.\n*   **Permissible Uses:** Limited to specific purposes including applications for credit, insurance, rentals, employment (with consent), court orders, 'legitimate' business needs in consumer-initiated transactions, account review, professional licensing, child support determinations, and law enforcement access. Targeted marketing is explicitly prohibited (e.g., *Trans Union v. FTC*, 2001).\n*   **Risk-Based Pricing Notices:** Creditors must notify consumers if offered credit terms are 'materially less favorable' due to information in their credit report.\n*   **Affiliate Marketing:** FACTA allows consumers to opt-out of affiliate marketing for five years (extendable), but other information exempted from 'consumer report' definition (e.g., transaction/experience data) is not subject to opt-out.\n*   **Medical Information:** A January 2025 CFPB rule prohibits the inclusion of medical debt on credit reports and consideration by creditors, removing an estimated $49 billion in medical bills from 15 million Americans' reports. This follows 2022 actions by major credit bureaus to exclude paid medical debts, medical debts less than a year old, and medical debts under $500.\n*   **Employment Background Checks:** Employers use consumer reports for hiring, promotion, reassignment, or retention. They must certify FCRA compliance, obtain written permission from applicants, and provide a copy of the report and a summary of FCRA rights if adverse action is considered. Limits apply to reporting old arrest data (generally not allowed after 7 years) and convictions (some states limit to 7 years). EEOC regulations require conviction relevance to the job.\n*   **Law Enforcement Access:** Federal, state, and municipal agencies can obtain credit header data. More detailed consumer report information generally requires a court order or subpoena. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened access for intelligence/counterintelligence investigations (e.g., § 1681u, § 1681v) without disclosing requests to the data subject or Congress.\n*   **State Protections (Preemption):** FCRA provides a federal baseline. It is only partially preemptive (15 U.S.C. § 1681t(a)), allowing states to pass broader protective laws unless there's a specific inconsistency. The CFPB clarified in 2022 that FCRA's preemption is 'narrow and targeted,' supporting state legislation on evictions, rental debts, or criminal records.\n\n**Consumer Rights:**\n*   **Right to Access Credit File:** Individuals are entitled to one free copy of their credit report annually from each of the three major CRAs via AnnualCreditReport.com. Additional reports can be purchased (up to $14.50). As of October 2023, weekly free access is permanently available. Free copies are also mandated after adverse action (within 60 days of notice), for unemployed individuals seeking jobs, reports inaccurate due to fraud, or individuals receiving welfare benefits.\n*   **Right to Correct Inaccurate Information:** Consumers can dispute inaccurate information directly with the CRA or the furnisher. CRAs must investigate disputes and remove inaccurate or unverifiable information within 30 days. Furnishers must investigate disputes within 30 days and update/remove incorrect info. Individuals can add a statement to their credit report if disputes are unresolved. Complaints can be submitted to the CFPB. Time limitations exist for negative information (e.g., bankruptcies removed after 10 years; civil suits, judgments, paid tax liens, collections, arrest records after 7 years; criminal convictions can remain indefinitely, but not for employment checks for jobs over $75,000 or credit/insurance over $150,000).\n*   **Identity Theft:** FCRA provides rights for victims. Victims can request transaction records (e.g., credit applications) related to theft from businesses, free of charge, within 30 days. FACTA added provisions like one-call fraud alerts (initial, extended, military duty alerts), requiring creditors to verify identity for new accounts and providing free credit reports. The 2018 Act established the right to a free credit freeze, allowing consumers to prevent new credit accounts. Credit freezes (per CRA) are generally more preventative than credit monitoring products. Consumers can also opt-out of 'prescreening' lists to reduce unsolicited offers and risk of identity theft.\n\n**Enforcement of FCRA:**\n*   **Private Right of Action:** Individuals can sue CRAs, users, and in some cases, furnishers (specifically for reinvestigation obligations after CRA request, not direct disputes). Successful plaintiffs may receive attorney's fees, court costs, and punitive damages. Qualified immunity (15 U.S.C. § 1681h(e)) limits liability for defamation, invasion of privacy, or negligence unless malice or willful intent is involved.\n*   **Public Enforcement:** Authority is shared by federal agencies (CFPB, FTC) depending on institution size and type, and by state attorney generals. The Dodd-Frank Act (2010) granted CFPB rulemaking authority and enforcement over 'larger participants' (including the 'Big Three'), while FTC retains authority over smaller participants and financial institutions.\n*   **Article III Standing Challenges:** Supreme Court decisions (*Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins* (2016) and *TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez* (2021)) have significantly limited individuals' ability to sue, requiring proof of 'concrete harm' beyond mere statutory violations. For example, in *TransUnion v. Ramirez*, only individuals whose false credit reports were *disclosed* to third parties had standing.\n*   **Accuracy Issues and Non-Compliance:** Inaccuracy remains a persistent problem. A CFPB report (August 2024) found violations including refusal to block identity theft information, failure to notify consumers of block denials, and furnishers providing inaccurate or unverifiable information. Recent enforcement actions include CFPB ordering Toyota Motor Credit to pay $60 million (2023) and CFPB/FTC action against TransUnion for $23 million (2023) for illegal rental background checks and credit reporting practices.", "specifications": {"enactment_year": 1970, "public_law_number": "91-508", "major_credit_bureaus": ["Experian", "Equifax", "TransUnion"], "credit_report_cost_limit":
